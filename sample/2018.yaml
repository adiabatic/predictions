title: Predictions for a past year
scope: in 2018

  This YAML file is hard-wrapped to 80 characters, but I’m only bothering
  to hard-wrap it because it looks better on GitHub that way. For files
  I use for myself, I rely on my text editor to wrap and indent long lines
  for me.

  it because I didn’t finish it until 2019.

  When I have a series of predictions for the same thing at different amounts,
  I consolidate the supporting evidence for the “happened” value of the series
  in the prediction that’s least likely to happen.
