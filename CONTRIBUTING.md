# Contributing to predictions

You want to make `predictions` better? Great! Unfortunately, I insist on contributors signing over copyright and I don’t have a way to handle that yet. Raise an Issue and I’ll look into getting a Contributor License Agreement bot set up.

## Style

### Use `goimports`

You use `goimports`, right? Of course you do. You have better things to do than manually format your code and add/remove imports.

### Do not manually wrap text in documentation comments

Let your editor do that. Manually-wrapped text tends to get broken in annoying places in Visual Studio Code.

### Use curly quotes and em dashes in all comments and strings

Curly quotes make everything look nicer, whether in `godoc`-style documentation or printed in an error message. Use curly quotes (“, ”, ‘, and ’) and proper em dashes (—).
